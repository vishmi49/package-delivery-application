## Design Decisions - Client Application

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The application follows a component-based structure where each UI element is built as a reusable component.
2. **Context API for State Management**: Used for managing shared state across components without prop drilling.
3. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: A CSS framework enables fast development and easy customization.
4. **React Router for Navigation**: Enables seamless client-side navigation.
5. **Auth0 for Authentication**: Provides secure user authentication and authorization.

## Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: The application follows a MVC architecture, separating routes, controllers, models, and middleware for maintainability.
2. **Express.js Framework**: Chosen for its flexibility, simplicity, and extensive middleware support.
3. **Authentication with Auth0**: Provides secure OAuth 2.0-based authentication and authorization.
4. **MongoDB for Storage**: A NoSQL database allowing for flexible schema design and scalability.
5. **Environment Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables securely.
